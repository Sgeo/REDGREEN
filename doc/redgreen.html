<h1>REDGREEN</h1>

<h2>Cellular Automaton</h2>

<p>REDGREEN is a successor to <a href="/projects/rube/">RUBE</a>.
Unlike RUBE, REDGREEN is proper cellular automaton (CA): the next
state of each cell is determined only by its current state and
the states of its neighbours.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>This implementation of REDGREEN is written in <a href="/projects/alpaca/">ALPACA</a>
and compiled to a Perl script using the reference ALPACA compiler.
As a language for expressing CA's, ALPACA is much, much clearer than
C (the language in which RUBE was implemented.)  In fact, the need for
a clear description language for RUBE's successor was one of the driving
forces behind the development of ALPACA.
REDGREEN is an extremely complex automaton, making full use of
ALPACA's "class of states" feature.</p>
